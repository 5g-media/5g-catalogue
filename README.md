# 5G Apps & Services Catalogue

The 5G Apps and Services Catalogue is a structured repository of heterogeneous media applications, functions and service descriptors based on a unified and extendable standard format, such as VNF Descriptor and NS Descriptor data models based on ETSI GS NFV SOL001 v2.5.1 and VNF Package structure based on ETSI GS NFV SOL004 v2.5.1. 

The catalogue offers NFV MANO and domain-specific translation functions from standard to specific or proprietary descriptors and packages format. In particular, in the context of 5G-MEDIA the 5G Apps and Services Catalogue provides an automated translation and mapping from the ETSI NFV standard TOSCA based VNF VNF Descriptor and NS Descriptors (used to model and describe the 5G-MEDIA media services) to the ETSI OSM specific data models.
